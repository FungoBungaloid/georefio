about=Automatically georeference maps, aerial photos, and sketches using the MatchAnything deep learning model. Simply navigate to the approximate location and let AI find the matching features.
    .
    Features:
    - Zero manual GCP placement - fully automated
    - Cross-modality support (maps to aerial, aerial to maps, sketches to maps)
    - Progressive multi-scale refinement for improved accuracy
    - GPU acceleration with automatic CPU fallback
    - Confidence-based match filtering
    .
    Requirements:
    - QGIS 3.22 or higher (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Python 3.9+ (bundled with QGIS)
    - 8 GB RAM minimum, 16 GB recommended
    - ~2 GB disk space for model cache
    - Optional: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA for faster processing
    .
    External Dependencies (auto-installed on first run):
    - PyTorch >= 2.0.0 and TorchVision >= 0.15.0 (deep learning framework)
    - Transformers >= 4.30.0 (HuggingFace model support)
    - OpenCV >= 4.8.0 (image processing)
    - SciPy >= 1.9.0 (scientific computing)
    .
    The plugin automatically downloads the AI model weights (~400 MB) from HuggingFace on first use.
    .
    Platform Support: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. GPU acceleration requires NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPU (optional, CPU fallback available).
